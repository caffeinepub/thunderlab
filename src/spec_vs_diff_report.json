  "summary": "Implemented a new protected Beat Maker route/page with UnlockGate, added an authenticated-only nav entry, built a step-sequencer hook + WebAudio playback for kick/snare/hi-hat with BPM control, and added offline rendering to downloadable WAV export. The “Add to Project” integration is not implemented; it currently only shows guidance via a toast, and a shared import helper was added but is a stub that throws.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-28",
      "requirement": "Integrate Beat Maker output with the existing \"import beats/audio\" workflow by allowing the user to add the generated beat audio into a project as an audio track (reuse same code path as importing an audio file).",
      "reason": "The Beat Maker page’s \"Add to Project\" action does not import/add the generated audio into a project; it only shows a toast suggesting navigation to Projects. A new shared helper (projectAudioImport.ts) is explicitly a placeholder and throws an error, so no working integration exists.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/BeatMakerPage.tsx (handleAddToProject shows toast guidance and does not call an import path)",
        "frontend/src/lib/projectAudioImport.ts (stub throws 'Project audio import not yet implemented')"
