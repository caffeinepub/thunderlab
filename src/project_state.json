  "summary": "Thunderlab is a mobile-first music production platform for emerging/independent artists, enabling multi-track vocal recording, beat import, essential audio effects (autotune, EQ, compression, reverb), cloud project saving, export of finished tracks, and sharing—designed to be simple, accessible, and smartphone-first. Future plans include collaboration tools, AI mastering, and creator community features while keeping core tools free.",

    "Mobile-first UX and performance as primary constraint (smartphone-first design).",
    "Authentication approach decision: require user-created password (move away from one-tap Internet Identity flow) to better address user privacy expectations.",

    "Plan to ship to Apple App Store and Google Play by wrapping the existing mobile-first web app in native shells (e.g., Capacitor) to produce iOS/Android builds for store submission.",
    "Scope expansion: add an internal beat-creation module (e.g., step sequencer/drum machine) rather than only importing external beats."
